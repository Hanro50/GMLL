		<h1>Generic Minecraft Launcher Library</h1>
		<p>
			GMLL is by no means a lightweight library. It is a fully featured modular
			core that will serve as a solid foundation for your Minecraft endeavours.
		</p>

		<h1>Features:</h1>
		<h2>Instance handling</h2>
		<img src="./assets/instances.png" />
		<p>
			Easily handle multiple instances with their own settings, loaded mods,
			mod-loaders and so much more. Includes the ability to save instance
			settings to file so you can easily load them up later.
		</p>
		<h2>Custom assets</h2>
		<img src="./assets/icon.png" />
		<p>
			Easily launch Minecraft with a custom icon, music or language file. GMLL
			will not only take care off copying the right file to the right location.
			It will write a custom asset index to ensure everything loads as planned
			without needing to override any existing files. This also means you can
			easily have multiple instances all with different icons without them
			conflicting with one another.
		</p>
		<h2>Easily wrap, upload and share mod-packs</h2>
		<img src="./assets/modpacks.png" />
		<p>
			GMLL includes the ability to easily wrap an instance and turn it into a
			mod-pack. This includes any saves that would be within the instance. Any
			custom configuration files and mods are also included as well as is any
			custom assets you have defined. It can use either fabric or forge as a
			mod-loader. It is smart enough to replace mod.jar files if they experience
			corruption, but to leave world files alone if they experience changes.
		</p>
		<h2>Forgiac!</h2>
		<img src="./assets/forge.png" />
		<p>
			GMLL includes forgiac. A powerful Java based tool to handle the
			installation and setup of Minecraft forge for you. It has 2 modes, namely
			manual and automatic. If you point it to a forge installer jar, it will
			automatically handle the installation of that jar and add it to the
			version.json file for gmll. It also provides a gui to allow a user to
			manually install forge into your launcher. Please note that you still need
			to obtain the forge installation jar yourself.<br />
			(As per the wishes of the forge development team)
		</p>
		<h2>Fabric</h2>
		<img src="./assets/fabric.png" />
		<p>
			GMLL will automatically generate a version manifest for fabric. Allowing
			you to easily install any fabric version as easily as any vanilla release
			without needing to download fabric directly. Also huge thank you to the
			fabric dev team.
		</p>
		<h2>Sound fix for legacy versions!</h2>
		<img src="./assets/soundfix.png" />
		<p>
			In the mood for a little blast from the past? Well now you can enjoy said
			adventure with audio to boot. GMLL accounts for how older versions of the
			game expect to be treated and makes adjustments to accommodate them. As
			such you can now enjoy the older versions as they where meant to be
			enjoyed...with sound.
